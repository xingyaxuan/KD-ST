# KD-ST


This is a Pytorch implementation of KD-ST: Distillation Knowledge-Based Space-Time Data Prediction on Industrial IoT Edge Devices.

Currently, IIoT tends to offer significant efficiency and productivity gains to industrial operations. 
Compared to traditional IoT consumer-oriented devices, IIoT is large-scale and faces more life-threatening or high-risk situations due to system failures and downtime. 
IIoT imperatively requires energy-saving equipment and secure operation to overcome the existences of high energy consumption, 
limited battery capacity, substantial safety hazard, and complex data processing. 
Outstandingly, edge computing has emerged as a promising technology to support IIoT systems by allocating computation and storage resources at the network edge. 
The proposed KD-ST can efficiently slove the problem that the existing deep learning algorithms are too high complexity to deploy on edge devices, 
achieved a good tradeoff between execution cost and model accuracy in model inference.
